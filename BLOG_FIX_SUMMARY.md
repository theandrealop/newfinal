# Blog Fix Summary - September 2025

## Issue Resolution
The blog functionality has been successfully fixed and is now working correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The blog was not broken per se, but had configuration inconsistencies:
- Mixed API endpoints in the codebase (old vs new URLs)
- Missing environment configuration for consistent endpoint usage
- Some components referencing outdated WordPress API URLs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration
Created `.env.local` with correct API endpoints:
```env
WP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://new-punti-furbi-draft-815f04.ingress-florina.ewp.live/graphql
WP_REST_ENDPOINT=https://new-punti-furbi-draft-815f04.ingress-florina.ewp.live/wp-json/wp/v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=https://new-punti-furbi-draft-815f04.ingress-florina.ewp.live/graphql
NEXT_PUBLIC_WP_REST_ENDPOINT=https://new-punti-furbi-draft-815f04.ingress-florina.ewp.live/wp-json/wp/v2
```

### 2. Verification Tests Performed
- ✅ GraphQL endpoint connectivity test
- ✅ WordPress REST API test
- ✅ Blog page build verification
- ✅ Article loading test
- ✅ Production server test
