# Next.js Build Issue Resolution

## Problem
The Next.js build was completing successfully, but an error was occurring: 
```
❌ 'out' directory does not exist.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that **dependencies were not installed** in the deployment environment. The build process requires all npm packages to be installed before Next.js can create the static export.

## Evidence
1. Initial error when running `npm run build`: `sh: 1: next: not found`
2. This indicated that Next.js wasn't available, meaning dependencies weren't installed

## Solution
1. **Install dependencies first**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Then run the build**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Result
After installing dependencies, the build completed successfully:
- ✅ Created 25 static pages
- ✅ Generated the `out/` directory with all static files
- ✅ Static export completed successfully

## Current Configuration
The project is correctly configured for static export:
- `next.config.mjs` has `output: 'export'`
- `trailingSlash: true` for better static hosting compatibility
- `images.unoptimized: true` for static export compatibility

## Generated Files
The `out/` directory now contains:
- HTML files for all pages
- Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
- Next.js build chunks in `_next/` directory
- `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `.htaccess`
- 404 error page

## Recommendation for CI/CD
Ensure your deployment pipeline includes:
1. `npm install` (or `npm ci` for production)
2. `npm run build`
3. Deploy the contents of the `out/` directory

The build process is working correctly - the issue was simply missing the dependency installation step.
